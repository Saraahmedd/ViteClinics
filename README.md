# Vite Clinics

Vite Clinics is an innovative virtual healthcare platform designed to revolutionize the patient and healthcare provider experience in Egypt. By leveraging the power of digital technology, Vite Clinics facilitates a comprehensive suite of services for both doctors and patients through an accessible online portal. The platform's primary aim is to streamline the process of healthcare delivery by offering a range of functionalities from appointment scheduling to telemedicine consultations.

## Motivation

The motivation behind Vite Clinics stems from the need to improve healthcare accessibility and convenience in today's fast-paced world. Challenges such as extended wait times, travel constraints, and the difficulty of managing health records and prescriptions are addressed head-on with Vite Clinics. The platform is crafted to empower patients with immediate access to healthcare services and information, while providing doctors with a robust tool to manage their practice efficiently. The motivation is further driven by the goal to digitize health records, making them easily accessible, and to facilitate seamless communication between patients and healthcare providers.

## Build Status

- The project is currently in development.
- All core tests are passed
- The development team is utilizing GitHub for version control
- To ensure a structured and organized development process, we have adopted the GitFlow workflow.

## Code Style

### Formatting:

- Prettier: we use Prettier as an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

### Code Reviews:

- Pull Requests: All code changes are submitted through pull requests on GitHub, which are then reviewed by peers. This process ensures adherence to our coding standards and allows for collective ownership of the code.

### Consistency:

- Naming Conventions: We use clear, meaningful variable and function names, following camelCase for JavaScript variables and functions, PascalCase for React component names, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants, and kebab-case for css classes.

- File Structure: We maintain a logical file structure, grouping related files in dedicated folders, and following a consistent naming convention for files and directories.
